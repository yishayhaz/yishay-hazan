            Hey there! I'm Yishay, an experienced developer specializing in
            building design systems for large & complex projects. My background
            spans full-stack applications, mobile apps, and software. That's
            just the professional part ;) in my free time, I played with tons of
            technology!
            <br />
            <br />I spend my days doing what I loveâ€”volunteering to teach
            children English and math, playing football, going for runs (21km
            soon!), taking a medics course, and diving into discussions on
            philosophy, psychology, and anything that teases my mind.
